### Introduction
[An article from CNN.com](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/11/asia/india-covid-death-rate-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html) mentions that despite India has the second-highest number of globally, and the third-highest number of deaths, the mortality rate has been surprisingly low. Indian healthcare workers are working day and night to save lives and the government of India deserves credit for managing the crisis in a country of 1.3 billion people, but according to CNN.com [some of the numbers may be misleading.](https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/11/asia/india-covid-death-rate-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html) For instance, not all hospitals are covered by the Health Ministry's "medical certification of the cause of death web portal". Some experts believe that [the number of COVID-19 deaths could be much larger.](https://thewire.in/health/watch-actual-covid-19-deaths-karan-thapar-hemant-shewade-giridara-gopal)In the future, most democratic governments would work toward battling epidemics by designing policies to deal with the spread of COVID-19 and similar transmissible diseases. Such policies would be based on studies that used numbers on COVID-19 deaths, recovery, rate of spread, etc. Unfortunately, data of poor quality will surely hurt a government's understanding and capacity to design effective policies. Experts like [Mitu Philips and colleagues (2020)](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27696) and nobel laureate [Avijit Banerjee](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27496)  are already working toward understanding why India's COVID-19 fatality is different from other countries'. [Patralekha Chatterjee (2020)](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2931857-2) provides a summary of shortcomings in reporting COVID-19 deaths in India. If the data on the COVID-19 crisis are not properly collected, curated, and managed, then it would be difficult to come up with effective policies, develop new methods to deal with 'gaps in the data', and make reproducible research results. In this short report, we will analyze some of the crucial facts about the COVID-19 crisis that the data uncovered and the possible biases that may arise from calculations based on the data.

### 1. State-level and District-level Heterogeneity
The existing data on India's COVID-19 crisis reflect "spatial heterogeneity" at level of state. Although we do not produce the figures on the COVID-19 cases at the district level, district-level heterogeneity exist too. Not all states, districts and subdistricts have the same capacity or infrastructure to provide healthcare to the affected persons, test possible cases, record cases and manage data, report data to the government bodies. But that is just one side of the story - capacity to handle cases and record them. Politicization of crisis, political climate would vary from one location to another. [Not every location has equal population density](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969720351925) which is a key factor in the spread of COVID-19. District-level migration may add another dimension of spatial heterogeneity in the spread of COVID-19 *within* and *between* state, district and subdistrict boundaries. A team led by [Paul Novosad and Sam Asher at the Development Data Lab](http://www.devdatalab.org/) collected data on COVID-19 cases in March 2020 to June 2020 on several states. The data is available [here](https://github.com/devdatalab/covid).

Unfortunately, in this report, we cannot provide the code to directly download, unzip and load the data on R or Rstudio. We were not able to generate a download link for the data files to produce such codes. The data is available in a dropbox managed by [Development Data Lab](https://github.com/devdatalab/covid). An interested individual may visit their project git and download the data themselves. For the sake of replicability, we will be keeping the variable names provided by Dr. Novosad and colleagues unchanged in the following sections. We cover merging and cleaning the data in the appendix. Please scroll down to the end of this page to see the the instructions and codes on merging cleaning the data.
